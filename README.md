# Isolation_forest
## Goal:
This project is an implementation of the original Isolation Forest algorithm by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, and Zhi-Hua Zhou.
## Algorithm:
Anomalies are few and different. Isolation forest algorithm focus on those anomaly points.                       
For your convenience, here are the algorithms extracted from the Liu et al paper:


## Example:
